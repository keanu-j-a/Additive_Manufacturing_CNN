This is a github repository of the code used to construct a rudimentary convolutional neural network (CNN) using keras, tensorflow, and jupyter notebooks.
Two CNN models are presented in this basic experiment. This dataset was trained on a dataset of 50,000 images of concrete bridge cracks. The CNN designed
sucessfully maintained an accuracy of 88 % on three epochs.

In order to reproduce the results of this experiment, please follow the steps outlined below:

1.) Download the kaggle repository in this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yidazhang07/bridge-cracks-image

2.) Copy and paste the code provided. Be sure to change the file path to your personal download loacation (commented in the code).

3.) Run the code and enjoy the results =)
